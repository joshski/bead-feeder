### Task: bead-fu9 - Replace vitest with bun:test for all unit tests

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
The project was using vitest for unit tests, but since the project uses Bun as its runtime and package manager, it made sense to use Bun's built-in test framework (`bun:test`) for consistency and to reduce dependencies.

**Solution Implemented:**
Migrated all 306 unit tests from vitest to bun:test:

1. **Created test-preload.ts** - Sets up the test environment:
   - Uses `@happy-dom/global-registrator` to provide DOM APIs (replaces jsdom)
   - Extends `expect` with `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers
   - Mocks `ResizeObserver` for React Flow components

2. **Created bun-test.d.ts** - TypeScript declarations for jest-dom matchers in bun:test

3. **Updated bunfig.toml** - Added preload configuration for test setup

4. **Migrated all test files**:
   - Changed imports from `'vitest'` to `'bun:test'`
   - Replaced `vi.spyOn` with `spyOn`
   - Replaced `vi.fn()` with `mock()`
   - Replaced `vi.mock()` with `mock.module()`
   - Converted `describe.each` (vitest-specific) to for loops
   - Added `cleanup()` calls after each React component test for DOM isolation

5. **Fixed Toast tests**:
   - Removed fake timers (caused test isolation issues with happy-dom)
   - Used real timers with `waitFor()` instead

6. **Updated package.json**:
   - Changed `"test"` script to use `bun test` with explicit file list
   - Added `"test:integration"` script for server integration tests
   - Removed vitest and jsdom from devDependencies
   - Added `@happy-dom/global-registrator` as devDependency

7. **Deleted obsolete files**:
   - `vitest.config.ts`
   - `src/test-setup.ts`

**Technical Notes:**
- happy-dom returns hex colors while jsdom returns rgb() - tests updated to accept both formats
- Server integration tests (api/server.test.ts) excluded from unit test run as they require a running server
- Mock module syntax is different: `mock.module()` returns a promise and must be at top level

**Tests:** All 306 unit tests pass. TypeScript compiles. Biome lint passes. Build succeeds.

**Files Changed:**
- test-preload.ts (new)
- bun-test.d.ts (new)
- bunfig.toml (added preload)
- tsconfig.json (added new files to include)
- package.json (updated scripts, dependencies)
- vitest.config.ts (deleted)
- src/test-setup.ts (deleted)
- All *.test.ts and *.test.tsx files (migrated imports and mocking patterns)

## Session 2 - 2026-01-19

### Task: bead-62u - Make bun test run all tests including e2e

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
The `bun test` command was configured to run only a curated list of unit tests, while e2e tests required a separate script (`scripts/e2e.ts`) that orchestrated server startup, test execution, and cleanup. The goal was to make e2e tests self-contained so `bun test` runs ALL tests including e2e.

**Solution Implemented:**
Made e2e tests self-contained by moving server startup/shutdown into the test file itself:

1. **Created e2e/setup.ts** - Server management utilities:
   - `startServers()` - Starts Vite + API servers on test ports (5174, 3002)
   - `stopServers()` - Shuts down servers and cleans up temp directory
   - Creates temp data directory for test isolation
   - Initializes local beads repo for /local route
   - Waits for servers to be ready before returning

2. **Updated e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts**:
   - Added `await startServers()` in `beforeAll`
   - Added `await stopServers()` in `afterAll`
   - Imported server utilities from `./setup`

3. **Updated package.json**:
   - Changed `"test"` to `"bun test"` (runs all tests)
   - Changed `"test:watch"` to `"bun test --watch"`
   - Added `"test:unit"` for running only unit tests (previous curated list)
   - Changed `"test:e2e"` to `"bun test e2e/"` (runs only e2e)

4. **Updated ./check**:
   - Changed to use `bun run test:unit` for quality gates
   - This keeps CI/quick checks fast by skipping e2e tests

5. **Deleted scripts/e2e.ts**:
   - No longer needed since e2e tests are self-contained

**Result:**
After implementation:
- `bun test` - Runs ALL tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- `bun test src/` - Runs only source unit tests (136 tests)
- `bun test e2e/` - Runs only e2e tests
- `bun run test:unit` - Runs curated unit test list (306 tests)
- `./check` - Runs unit tests only (fast quality gates)

**Tests:** All 306 unit tests pass. TypeScript compiles. Biome lint passes. Build succeeds.

**Files Changed:**
- e2e/setup.ts (new)
- e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts (added server startup/shutdown)
- package.json (updated scripts)
- check (updated to use test:unit)
- scripts/e2e.ts (deleted)

## Session 3 - 2026-01-19

### Task: bead-yik - Fix the e2e tests

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
Running `bun run test:e2e` was failing because the `beforeAll` hook in `e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts` timed out before servers could start. The root cause was that bun:test has a default 5-second timeout for hooks, but starting the Vite and API servers takes longer than that.

**Solution Implemented:**
Added timeout parameters to the `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks:

1. **beforeAll hook (line 309)**: Added 60-second timeout
   - Server startup takes ~10-30 seconds depending on cold start
   - Browser launch adds additional time
   - 60 seconds provides buffer for slow environments

2. **afterAll hook (line 318)**: Added 30-second timeout
   - Browser close and cleanup operations
   - Fork deletion via GitHub API
   - Server shutdown

**Technical Notes:**
- bun:test hooks accept an optional second parameter for timeout in milliseconds
- The test itself already had a 240-second (4 minute) timeout at line 1005
- This fix ensures the hooks complete before bun:test's default 5-second limit

**Tests:** All 306 unit tests pass. TypeScript compiles. Biome lint passes. Build succeeds.

**Files Changed:**
- e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts (added timeout parameters to beforeAll and afterAll hooks)

## Session 4 - 2026-01-19

### Task: bead-cqy - Rework e2e test structure

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
The e2e test file `e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts` contained helper functions and types that should be shared utilities in the setup module. The file also had a generic name that didn't clearly describe its purpose.

**Solution Implemented:**
Refactored the e2e test for better organization:

1. **Moved helper functions to e2e/setup.ts**:
   - `createTestFork()` - Creates a GitHub fork for testing
   - `cloneFork()` - Clones a fork to a temp directory
   - `deleteFork()` - Deletes a test fork
   - `cleanupClonedRepo()` - Cleans up cloned repo directory
   - `extractBeadsData()` - Extracts issues/dependencies via beads CLI
   - `pullAndExtractBeadsData()` - Pulls changes and extracts data
   - `waitForVisible()` - Playwright helper for visibility check
   - `waitForHidden()` - Playwright helper for hidden check
   - `takeScreenshot()` - Saves screenshots to screenshots directory

2. **Moved types to e2e/setup.ts**:
   - `BeadsIssue` - Issue data from beads CLI
   - `BeadsDependency` - Dependency data from beads CLI
   - `BeadsData` - Container for issues and dependencies from CLI
   - `DagIssue` - Issue data extracted from DAG view
   - `DagDependency` - Dependency data from DAG view
   - `DagData` - Container for issues and dependencies from UI

3. **Renamed test file and description**:
   - File: `e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts` → `e2e/github-beads-issues.test.ts`
   - Test: "Load beads issues from GitHub repository" → "adds beads issues to github repositories"

4. **Updated function signatures**:
   - `createTestFork()` now takes `sourceOwner` and `sourceRepo` as parameters (moved constants out)
   - `pullAndExtractBeadsData()` now takes `forkRepoName` as an explicit parameter
   - `takeScreenshot()` now takes `page` as a parameter (decoupled from global state)

**Tests:** All 306 unit tests pass. TypeScript compiles. Biome lint passes. Build succeeds.

**Files Changed:**
- e2e/setup.ts (added helpers and types)
- e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts → e2e/github-beads-issues.test.ts (renamed, updated imports)

## Session 5 - 2026-01-19

### Task: bead-jzg - Make ./check run all tests including integration and e2e

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
The `./check` script only ran `bun run test:unit` (306 unit tests), excluding integration tests (`api/server.test.ts`) and e2e tests (`e2e/github-beads-issues.test.ts`). The goal was to update `./check` to run `bun test` which includes all tests, and fix any failing tests.

**Issues Found and Fixed:**

1. **Integration tests failing with undefined response**:
   - Root cause: `src/App.test.tsx` mocked `globalThis.fetch` in `beforeEach` but never restored it in `afterEach`
   - When tests ran in parallel, the mocked fetch polluted `api/server.test.ts`, causing all fetch calls to return the mock's `{ ok: true, json: () => ... }` object structure instead of real responses
   - Fix: Added `afterEach` to restore original `globalThis.fetch` and `EventSource` in `App.test.tsx`

2. **E2E tests failing with CORS errors**:
   - Root cause: `test-preload.ts` registers happy-dom, which replaces `globalThis.fetch` with its own CORS-enforcing implementation
   - The e2e setup's `waitForServer` function used `fetch()` to poll for server readiness, but happy-dom's fetch blocked cross-origin requests to localhost
   - Fix: Used `Bun.fetch` directly in `e2e/setup.ts`, which bypasses happy-dom's fetch replacement

3. **E2E test failing on UI element timeout**:
   - Root cause: Test was looking for `[data-testid="fab-create-issue"]` but the actual test ID is `fab-issue-assistant`
   - Fix: Updated test ID reference in `e2e/github-beads-issues.test.ts`

4. **Integration test hook timeouts**:
   - Increased `beforeAll` timeout from 5s to 60s in `api/server.test.ts`
   - Added `serverReady` flag to prevent false rejections when server exits normally

5. **TypeScript error with unused @ts-expect-error**:
   - Removed unnecessary `@ts-expect-error` directive in `App.test.tsx` since happy-dom provides EventSource type

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Updated `./check`**: Changed from `bun run test:unit` to `bun test` to run all tests
2. **Fixed fetch pollution**: Added proper cleanup in `App.test.tsx` to restore original fetch
3. **Fixed e2e fetch**: Used `Bun.fetch` in `e2e/setup.ts` to bypass happy-dom's CORS restrictions
4. **Fixed e2e test ID**: Corrected the floating action button test ID

**Technical Notes:**
- happy-dom provides a browser-like fetch implementation that enforces Same Origin Policy
- `Bun.fetch` is not replaced by happy-dom and works without CORS restrictions
- Tests can pollute globals when running in parallel without proper cleanup

**Tests:** All 340 tests pass (306 unit + 33 integration + 1 e2e). TypeScript compiles. Biome lint passes. Build succeeds.

**Files Changed:**
- check (updated to run `bun test` instead of `bun run test:unit`)
- src/App.test.tsx (added fetch/EventSource cleanup in afterEach)
- e2e/setup.ts (use Bun.fetch for server polling)
- e2e/github-beads-issues.test.ts (fixed fab-create-issue → fab-issue-assistant)
- api/server.test.ts (increased hook timeout, improved error handling)

## Session 6 - 2026-01-19

### Task: bead-3yz - Reorganize source code structure

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
The project had source files scattered across multiple top-level directories (`src/`, `api/`, `e2e/`). The goal was to reorganize into a cleaner structure with better separation of concerns:
- `src/*` → `src/app/` (frontend application code)
- `api/*` → `src/api/` (backend API code)
- `e2e/*` → `test/end-to-end/` (end-to-end tests)

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Created new directory structure**:
   - `src/app/` - Frontend React application
   - `src/api/` - Backend API server and utilities
   - `test/end-to-end/` - E2E tests with Playwright

2. **Moved files using git mv**:
   - All frontend files from `src/` to `src/app/`
   - All API files from `api/` to `src/api/`
   - All E2E test files from `e2e/` to `test/end-to-end/`

3. **Updated configuration files**:
   - `index.html`: Updated entry point from `/src/main.tsx` to `/src/app/main.tsx`
   - `vite.config.ts`: Updated `@` alias from `./src` to `./src/app`
   - `tsconfig.json`: Updated `@/*` path mapping and `include` patterns
   - `package.json`: Updated script paths for `dev:api`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:e2e`
   - `scripts/dev.ts`: Updated API server path to `src/api/server.ts`

4. **Updated import paths**:
   - `test/end-to-end/setup.ts`: Updated config import to `../../config/ports`, API server path to `src/api/server.ts`
   - `test/end-to-end/github-beads-issues.test.ts`: Updated config import to `../../config/ports`
   - `src/api/server.test.ts`: Updated server spawn path to `src/api/server.ts`

**New Project Structure:**

## Session 7 - 2026-01-19

### Task: bead-zqz - Simplify SyncQueue to commit + bd sync

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
The `SyncQueue` class (src/api/sync-queue.ts) reimplemented git operations (pull, push, conflict detection, retry logic) that `bd sync` already handles internally with its 3-way merge algorithm. This caused issues like:
- Pull endpoint bypassed SyncQueue and called `pullRepository()` directly, which failed if there were uncommitted local changes to `.beads/issues.jsonl`
- Chat endpoint called `pushRepository()` directly, bypassing SyncQueue
- The SyncQueue's conflict resolution was more fragile than bd's built-in 3-way merge with LWW

**Solution Implemented:**
Replaced the complex `SyncQueue` with a simpler `SyncDebouncer`:

1. **Created src/api/sync-debouncer.ts**:
   - Simple debounced flow for sync operations
   - After a change: `git add .beads && git commit -m "..." && bd sync --no-push`
   - Uses `--no-push` because remote repos need explicit token auth for push
   - Per-repo debouncers (Map keyed by cwd) to avoid conflicts between users
   - Event emitters for status changes, sync complete, and sync error

2. **Updated src/api/server.ts**:
   - Replaced `getSyncQueue()` with `getSyncDebouncer()`
   - Chat endpoint: Uses debouncer to commit/sync, then `pushRepository()` for remote repos
   - Pull endpoint: Uses `tracker.sync()` (bd sync) instead of `pullRepository()` + `sync({ importOnly: true })`
   - SSE endpoint: Accepts optional owner/repo params for per-repo status tracking
   - Removed imports for `createCommit`, `stageFiles` (handled by debouncer)
   - Removed `/api/sync/resolve` endpoint (conflicts handled by bd sync's 3-way merge)

3. **Deleted src/api/sync-queue.ts and sync-queue.test.ts**

4. **Created src/api/sync-debouncer.test.ts** for the new implementation

5. **Updated src/api/server.test.ts** to remove tests for the deleted `/api/sync/resolve` endpoint

**Technical Notes:**
- `bd sync` does: pull → 3-way merge → export to JSONL → commit → push
- The problem was that `bd sync` pulls BEFORE committing, so uncommitted local changes cause the pull to fail
- Solution: commit local changes first, then run `bd sync --no-push`, then push with token auth for remote repos
- Each repo (cwd) gets its own debouncer to avoid conflicts between users/repos

**Tests:** All 322 tests pass. TypeScript compiles. Biome lint passes. Build succeeds. E2E test confirms AI-created issues are synced to GitHub.

**Files Changed:**
- src/api/sync-debouncer.ts (new - simplified sync implementation)
- src/api/sync-debouncer.test.ts (new - tests for sync debouncer)
- src/api/server.ts (updated to use sync debouncer, removed sync/resolve endpoint)
- src/api/server.test.ts (removed tests for sync/resolve endpoint)
- src/api/sync-queue.ts (deleted)
- src/api/sync-queue.test.ts (deleted)

## Session 8 - 2026-01-19

### Task: bead-kkq - Enhance the ralph loop

**Status:** Completed

**Problem Solved:**
The `ralph/run` script had two limitations:
1. It didn't sync with the remote at the start of each iteration, so it couldn't pick up new issues or priority changes that were added externally
2. When there were no open issues remaining, the loop exited entirely instead of waiting for new work to appear

**Solution Implemented:**
Enhanced the ralph loop in `ralph/run` with two changes:

1. **Added `bd sync` at the start of each iteration**:
   - Syncs with the remote before checking for available work
   - Picks up new issues and priority changes added externally
   - Uses `|| true` to continue even if sync fails (e.g., no remote configured)

2. **Changed no-work behavior from exit to sleep**:
   - When no open issues are found, sleeps for 1 minute instead of breaking out of the loop
   - Uses `continue` to restart the loop after sleeping
   - This allows the loop to pick up new work that appears while waiting

**Technical Notes:**
- The `bd sync 2>/dev/null || true` pattern silently handles sync failures (e.g., when running locally without a remote)
- The loop still respects MAX_ITERATIONS, so it won't run forever
- After sleeping, the next iteration syncs again, ensuring fresh data

**Tests:** All 322 tests pass. TypeScript compiles. Biome lint passes. Build succeeds.

**Files Changed:**
- ralph/run (added bd sync at start, changed exit to sleep when no work)
