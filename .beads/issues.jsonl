The backend runs `bd graph` in its local working directory instead of fetching issues from the selected repository.\n\n## Solution\n\nFetch `.beads/issues.jsonl` directly from GitHub using the existing Contents API pattern, then transform it into the graph format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n### 1. `src/pages/DagView.tsx`\n- Import `useParams` from `react-router-dom`\n- Extract `owner` and `repo` from URL params\n- Pass them to `fetchGraph()` as query parameters\n- Include `credentials: 'include'` on fetch to pass the auth cookie\n\n### 2. `api/server.ts`\n- Modify `/api/graph` endpoint to accept optional `owner` and `repo` query params\n- When params provided:\n  - Require authentication (token from cookie)\n  - Fetch `.beads/issues.jsonl` via GitHub Contents API\n  - Decode base64 content and parse JSONL\n  - Build `GraphApiResponse[]` format from issues\n- When params not provided: keep existing local `bd graph` behavior\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Frontend Changes (DagView.tsx)\n\n```typescript\nimport { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'\n\n// In fetchGraph function signature:\nasync function fetchGraph(owner?: string, repo?: string): Promise\u003c...\u003e\n\n// Build URL with query params:\nconst url = new URL(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/graph`)\nif (owner \u0026\u0026 repo) {\n  url.searchParams.set('owner', owner)\n  url.searchParams.set('repo', repo)\n}\nconst response = await fetch(url.toString(), { credentials: 'include' })\n\n// In DagView component:\nconst { owner, repo } = useParams\u003c{ owner?: string; repo?: string }\u003e()\n\n// Pass to fetchGraph:\nconst { nodes, edges } = await fetchGraph(owner, repo)\n```\n\n### Backend Changes (server.ts)\n\n```typescript\n// In /api/graph handler:\nconst owner = url.searchParams.get('owner')\nconst repo = url.searchParams.get('repo')\n\nif (owner \u0026\u0026 repo) {\n  // Fetch from GitHub\n  const token = getTokenFromCookies(req)\n  if (!token) return 401 response\n\n  // Fetch issues.jsonl via GitHub Contents API\n  const ghResponse = await fetch(\n    `https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/contents/.beads/issues.jsonl`,\n    { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, Accept: 'application/vnd.github+json' }}\n  )\n\n  // Decode base64, parse JSONL, build graph format\n  const { content } = await ghResponse.json()\n  const decoded = atob(content)\n  const issues = decoded.trim().split('\\n').map(line =\u003e JSON.parse(line))\n\n  // Transform to GraphApiResponse format\n  const graphs = buildGraphsFromIssues(issues)\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(graphs), ...)\n} else {\n  // Existing local behavior\n  const json = await runBdCommand(['graph', '--all', '--json'])\n  return new Response(json, ...)\n}\n```\n\n### Graph Building Logic\n\nThe `buildGraphsFromIssues()` helper will:\n1. Filter out tombstone issues (status === 'tombstone')\n2. Build dependency map from each issue's `dependencies` array\n3. Find root issues (no incoming dependencies)\n4. Build `GraphApiResponse` objects with Root, Issues, Dependencies, IssueMap\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Start the app: `bun run dev`\n2. Open browser, log in with GitHub\n3. Select a repository that has `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n4. Verify issues appear in DAG view\n5. Also verify local mode still works when accessing `/api/graph` directly without params","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T07:59:56.547686591Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-14T08:25:06.891607968Z","closed_at":"2026-01-14T08:25:06.891607968Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
