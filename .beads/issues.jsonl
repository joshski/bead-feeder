{"id":"bead-3f5","title":"Improve DAG edge routing with bezier curves and increased spacing","description":"## Problem\n\nIn the DAG view, dependency lines look tidy on the left side of cards but messy on the right side. This happens because:\n\n1. All edges use `smoothstep` type which creates right-angle curves that look awkward when multiple edges fan out from the same point\n2. The node spacing is tight (20px), giving edges little room to route without overlapping\n3. All edges exit/enter from a single center handle point on each card\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Change edge type from `smoothstep` to `default` (bezier curves)\n\n**File:** `src/transformers/dependencyToEdge.ts`\n\nChange line 24 from:\n```tsx\ntype: 'smoothstep',\n```\nto:\n```tsx\ntype: 'default',\n```\n\nAlso update `src/components/DagCanvas.tsx` line 65 where edges are added dynamically on connect.\n\nBezier curves provide smoother, more natural-looking connections that handle fanning better than stepped edges.\n\n### 2. Increase node spacing to reduce edge crossings\n\n**File:** `src/transformers/dagLayout.ts`\n\nUpdate the DEFAULT_OPTIONS (lines 33-39):\n- Increase `nodeSpacingX` from 20 to 50-80 (horizontal gap between ranks)\n- Increase `nodeSpacingY` from 20 to 40-60 (vertical gap between nodes in same rank)\n\nThe dagre library already minimizes edge crossings algorithmically, but tight spacing forces edges to overlap. More space allows the routing to spread edges apart.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `src/transformers/dependencyToEdge.ts` - Change edge type\n- `src/components/DagCanvas.tsx` - Change edge type for dynamic edges\n- `src/transformers/dagLayout.ts` - Increase spacing values\n\n## Testing\n\n- Visual inspection of DAG view with multiple dependencies\n- Verify edges look cleaner on both sides of cards\n- Check that increased spacing doesn't make the graph too spread out\n- Test with varying numbers of nodes and dependency patterns\n\n## Future Considerations\n\nIf these changes aren't sufficient, a more complex solution would involve distributing handles vertically along card edges based on the number of connections, assigning each edge to a specific handle via `sourceHandle`/`targetHandle` properties. This would require knowing edge counts per node in advance.","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:29:59.551051Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Test authenticates with GitHub successfully\n2. Selects the test repository (josh-beads-test-1/bead-feeder-example-issues)\n3. CLI extracts 10 issues and 12 dependencies correctly\n4. UI shows 'Synced' status\n5. But DAG view is empty (0 issues visible)\n6. Screenshot confirms: React Flow canvas is empty despite sync completing\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe test waits for 'Synced' text to appear (line 375 in load-beads-issues.spec.ts), but this doesn't guarantee that:\n- Issues have been fetched from the API\n- Issue nodes have been rendered in React Flow\n\nThere's a race condition between:\n- Sync status updating to 'Synced'\n- Actual issue data being fetched and rendered\n\n## Relevant Code\n\n```typescript\n// e2e/load-beads-issues.spec.ts:374-379\n// Verify sync status shows 'Synced'\nawait expect(page.getByText('Synced')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })\n\n// Check for issue nodes (may be empty if test repo has no issues)\nconst issueNodes = page.locator('[data-testid=\"issue-node\"]')\nconst issueCount = await issueNodes.count()\n```\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd explicit waiting for issue nodes to appear after sync completes:\n\n1. After waiting for 'Synced', wait for at least one issue node to be visible\n2. Add retry logic with timeout for issue node appearance\n3. Add logging to understand timing of sync vs render\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n- e2e/load-beads-issues.spec.ts - test file\n- src/components/DAGView.tsx - React Flow rendering\n- src/hooks/useIssues.ts or similar - issue loading logic\n- src/api/ - API calls for fetching issues after sync","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T15:29:48.060831837Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bead-feeder-6w9","title":"Pass repository context to graph API","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen a user selects a GitHub repository, the DagView navigates to `/repos/:owner/:repo` but never extracts the URL params or passes them to the API. The backend runs `bd graph` in its local working directory instead of fetching issues from the selected repository.\n\n## Solution\n\nFetch `.beads/issues.jsonl` directly from GitHub using the existing Contents API pattern, then transform it into the graph format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n### 1. `src/pages/DagView.tsx`\n- Import `useParams` from `react-router-dom`\n- Extract `owner` and `repo` from URL params\n- Pass them to `fetchGraph()` as query parameters\n- Include `credentials: 'include'` on fetch to pass the auth cookie\n\n### 2. `api/server.ts`\n- Modify `/api/graph` endpoint to accept optional `owner` and `repo` query params\n- When params provided:\n  - Require authentication (token from cookie)\n  - Fetch `.beads/issues.jsonl` via GitHub Contents API\n  - Decode base64 content and parse JSONL\n  - Build `GraphApiResponse[]` format from issues\n- When params not provided: keep existing local `bd graph` behavior\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Frontend Changes (DagView.tsx)\n\n```typescript\nimport { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'\n\n// In fetchGraph function signature:\nasync function fetchGraph(owner?: string, repo?: string): Promise\u003c...\u003e\n\n// Build URL with query params:\nconst url = new URL(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/graph`)\nif (owner \u0026\u0026 repo) {\n  url.searchParams.set('owner', owner)\n  url.searchParams.set('repo', repo)\n}\nconst response = await fetch(url.toString(), { credentials: 'include' })\n\n// In DagView component:\nconst { owner, repo } = useParams\u003c{ owner?: string; repo?: string }\u003e()\n\n// Pass to fetchGraph:\nconst { nodes, edges } = await fetchGraph(owner, repo)\n```\n\n### Backend Changes (server.ts)\n\n```typescript\n// In /api/graph handler:\nconst owner = url.searchParams.get('owner')\nconst repo = url.searchParams.get('repo')\n\nif (owner \u0026\u0026 repo) {\n  // Fetch from GitHub\n  const token = getTokenFromCookies(req)\n  if (!token) return 401 response\n\n  // Fetch issues.jsonl via GitHub Contents API\n  const ghResponse = await fetch(\n    `https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/contents/.beads/issues.jsonl`,\n    { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, Accept: 'application/vnd.github+json' }}\n  )\n\n  // Decode base64, parse JSONL, build graph format\n  const { content } = await ghResponse.json()\n  const decoded = atob(content)\n  const issues = decoded.trim().split('\\n').map(line =\u003e JSON.parse(line))\n\n  // Transform to GraphApiResponse format\n  const graphs = buildGraphsFromIssues(issues)\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(graphs), ...)\n} else {\n  // Existing local behavior\n  const json = await runBdCommand(['graph', '--all', '--json'])\n  return new Response(json, ...)\n}\n```\n\n### Graph Building Logic\n\nThe `buildGraphsFromIssues()` helper will:\n1. Filter out tombstone issues (status === 'tombstone')\n2. Build dependency map from each issue's `dependencies` array\n3. Find root issues (no incoming dependencies)\n4. Build `GraphApiResponse` objects with Root, Issues, Dependencies, IssueMap\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Start the app: `bun run dev`\n2. Open browser, log in with GitHub\n3. Select a repository that has `.beads/issues.jsonl`\n4. Verify issues appear in DAG view\n5. Also verify local mode still works when accessing `/api/graph` directly without params","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T07:59:56.547686591Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bead-gnn","title":"Always use local clone for remote GitHub repos","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently the app has two different code paths for remote GitHub repos:\n\n1. **Reading issues**: Fetches `.beads/issues.jsonl` directly via GitHub Contents API (server.ts lines 294-352)\n2. **Writing issues**: Uses `bd` CLI commands which require a local clone\n\nThis creates issues:\n- The JSONL file can get massive, making API fetches slow\n- Chat/issue creation doesn't work for remote repos (no local clone to run `bd` against)\n- Two different code paths to maintain\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAlways clone remote GitHub repos locally before operating on them:\n\n1. When user selects a GitHub repo → sparse clone only the `.beads` directory\n2. All operations (read graph, create issues via chat) use `bd` commands against the local clone\n3. Use existing SyncQueue/git-service infrastructure to push changes back to GitHub\n\n## Sparse Checkout Approach\n\nUse git sparse checkout to clone only the `.beads` directory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --filter=blob:none --sparse \u003crepo-url\u003e\ngit sparse-checkout set .beads\n```\n\nThis avoids downloading source code, assets, or other files - only the issue tracking data.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Unified code path using `bd` CLI for everything\n- Chat feature works for all repos, not just local ones\n- Better performance for large repos (no repeated API fetches of massive JSONL)\n- Minimal disk space - only `.beads` directory is cloned\n- Fast clones even for massive monorepos\n- Leverages existing git-service.ts and SyncQueue infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Clone repos to `getRepoPath(owner, repo)` directory structure\n- Use sparse checkout to fetch only `.beads` directory\n- May need clone-on-demand or eager clone when repo is selected\n- Consider showing clone progress indicator","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-16T17:18:06.052976464Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-16T17:27:40.901920008Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T17:27:40.901920008Z","close_reason":"Closed"}

Observe the error in the server logs","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-16T16:20:25.922059221Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-16T16:39:39.482769463Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T16:39:39.482769463Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
