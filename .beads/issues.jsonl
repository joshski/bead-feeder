{"id":"bead-3f5","title":"Improve DAG edge routing with bezier curves and increased spacing","description":"## Problem\n\nIn the DAG view, dependency lines look tidy on the left side of cards but messy on the right side. This happens because:\n\n1. All edges use `smoothstep` type which creates right-angle curves that look awkward when multiple edges fan out from the same point\n2. The node spacing is tight (20px), giving edges little room to route without overlapping\n3. All edges exit/enter from a single center handle point on each card\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Change edge type from `smoothstep` to `default` (bezier curves)\n\n**File:** `src/transformers/dependencyToEdge.ts`\n\nChange line 24 from:\n```tsx\ntype: 'smoothstep',\n```\nto:\n```tsx\ntype: 'default',\n```\n\nAlso update `src/components/DagCanvas.tsx` line 65 where edges are added dynamically on connect.\n\nBezier curves provide smoother, more natural-looking connections that handle fanning better than stepped edges.\n\n### 2. Increase node spacing to reduce edge crossings\n\n**File:** `src/transformers/dagLayout.ts`\n\nUpdate the DEFAULT_OPTIONS (lines 33-39):\n- Increase `nodeSpacingX` from 20 to 50-80 (horizontal gap between ranks)\n- Increase `nodeSpacingY` from 20 to 40-60 (vertical gap between nodes in same rank)\n\nThe dagre library already minimizes edge crossings algorithmically, but tight spacing forces edges to overlap. More space allows the routing to spread edges apart.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `src/transformers/dependencyToEdge.ts` - Change edge type\n- `src/components/DagCanvas.tsx` - Change edge type for dynamic edges\n- `src/transformers/dagLayout.ts` - Increase spacing values\n\n## Testing\n\n- Visual inspection of DAG view with multiple dependencies\n- Verify edges look cleaner on both sides of cards\n- Check that increased spacing doesn't make the graph too spread out\n- Test with varying numbers of nodes and dependency patterns\n\n## Future Considerations\n\nIf these changes aren't sufficient, a more complex solution would involve distributing handles vertically along card edges based on the number of connections, assigning each edge to a specific handle via `sourceHandle`/`targetHandle` properties.

{"id":"bead-62u","title":"Make bun test run all tests including e2e","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently:\n- **`bun test`** - Bun's built-in test runner that auto-discovers ALL `.test.ts` files, but e2e tests fail because they need running servers\n- **`bun run test`** - Runs an explicit curated list of test files (excludes e2e)\n\nThe user wants the literal `bun test` command to run everything including e2e.\n\n## Current Test Configuration\n\n**package.json scripts:**\n```json\n\"test\": \"bun test src api/logger.test.ts api/buildGraphsFromIssues.test.ts ...\",\n\"test:integration\": \"bun test api/server.test.ts\",\n\"test:e2e\": \"bun run scripts/e2e.ts\"\n```\n\n**Test locations:**\n- `src/**/*.test.ts` - Unit tests\n- `api/*.test.ts` - API unit and integration tests\n- `api/issue-tracker/*.test.ts` - Contract tests\n- `e2e/*.test.ts` - E2E tests (currently require external servers)\n\n## Key Challenge\n\nE2E tests currently depend on `scripts/e2e.ts` to:\n1. Create a temporary data directory for isolation\n2. Initialize a local beads repo\n3. Start Vite dev server on test port (5174)\n4. Start API server on test port (3002)\n5. Wait for servers to be ready\n6. Clean up after tests complete\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Make e2e tests self-contained** by moving server startup/shutdown into the test file itself.\n\n### 1. Create `e2e/setup.ts` - Shared E2E Test Setup Module\n\nExtract the server management logic from `scripts/e2e.ts` into a reusable module:\n- `startServers()` - Starts Vite + API servers, returns cleanup function\n- `waitForServers()` - Waits for servers to be ready\n- Handles temp directory creation and cleanup\n\n### 2. Update `e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts`\n\nAdd server startup in `beforeAll`:\n```typescript\nimport { startServers, stopServers } from './setup'\n\nlet cleanup: () =\u003e void\n\nbeforeAll(async () =\u003e {\n  cleanup = await startServers()\n  // ... existing browser setup\n})\n\nafterAll(async () =\u003e {\n  // ... existing cleanup\n  cleanup?.()\n})\n```\n\n### 3. Update `package.json`\n\nSimplify the test script to just run bun test:\n```json\n\"test\": \"bun test\"\n```\n\n### 4. Keep `test:e2e` for Running E2E Only\n\n```json\n\"test:e2e\": \"bun test e2e/\"\n```\n\n### 5. Delete `scripts/e2e.ts` (Optional)\n\nNo longer needed since e2e tests are self-contained.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| `e2e/setup.ts` | Create - Server management utilities |\n| `e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts` | Modify - Add server startup/shutdown |\n| `package.json` | Modify - Simplify test script |\n| `scripts/e2e.ts` | Delete - No longer needed |\n\n## Result\n\nAfter implementation:\n- `bun test` - Runs ALL tests (unit, integration, e2e)\n- `bun test src/` - Runs only unit tests\n- `bun test e2e/` - Runs only e2e tests\n- `bun run test` - Same as `bun test`\n- `./check` - Still works (uses `bun run test`)\n\n## Verification\n\n```bash\nbun test              # Should run all tests including e2e\nbun test src/         # Should run only unit tests (fast)\nbun test e2e/         # Should run only e2e tests\n./check               # Should pass\n```","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T06:35:37.455229799Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-19T06:35:37.455229799Z"}

The function recursively calls itself infinitely when trying to acquire a lock for starting a daemon.\n\n**Root cause:** The bd CLI's daemon startup logic has a bug that triggers when bd is spawned as a child process from certain contexts (like the Bun/Node API server).

When the API calls 'bd graph --all --json' via spawn(), it crashes with 'runtime: goroutine stack exceeds 1000000000-byte limit'\n\n**Fix:**\nIn api/issue-tracker/BeadsIssueTracker.ts, set BD_NO_DAEMON=true in the environment when spawning bd commands.

{"id":"bead-e71","title":"E2E test: Issues don't reliably load in DAG view after sync completes","description":"## Problem\n\nThe e2e test `test:e2e:load-issues` fails intermittently because issues don't reliably appear in the DAG view even after the 'Synced' status is shown.\n\n## Observed Behavior\n\n1. Test authenticates with GitHub successfully\n2. Selects the test repository (josh-beads-test-1/bead-feeder-example-issues)\n3. CLI extracts 10 issues and 12 dependencies correctly\n4. UI shows 'Synced' status\n5. But DAG view is empty (0 issues visible)\n6. Screenshot confirms: React Flow canvas is empty despite sync completing\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe test waits for 'Synced' text to appear (line 375 in load-beads-issues.spec.ts), but this doesn't guarantee that:\n- Issues have been fetched from the API\n- Issue nodes have been rendered in React Flow\n\nThere's a race condition between:\n- Sync status updating to 'Synced'\n- Actual issue data being fetched and rendered\n\n## Relevant Code\n\n```typescript\n// e2e/load-beads-issues.spec.ts:374-379\n// Verify sync status shows 'Synced'\nawait expect(page.getByText('Synced')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })\n\n// Check for issue nodes (may be empty if test repo has no issues)\nconst issueNodes = page.locator('[data-testid=\"issue-node\"]')\nconst issueCount = await issueNodes.count()\n```\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd explicit waiting for issue nodes to appear after sync completes:\n\n1. After waiting for 'Synced', wait for at least one issue node to be visible\n2. Add retry logic with timeout for issue node appearance\n3. Add logging to understand timing of sync vs render\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\n- e2e/load-beads-issues.spec.ts - test file\n- src/components/DAGView.tsx - React Flow rendering\n- src/hooks/useIssues.ts or similar - issue loading logic\n- src/api/ - API calls for fetching issues after sync","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T15:29:48.060831837Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2026-01-16T13:45:08.905552959Z","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"bead-fu9","title":"Unify test runners: standardize on bun:test","description":"## Problem\nCurrently `bun test` and `bun run test` do very different things, which is confusing:\n- `bun run test` → vitest (unit tests only)\n- `bun test` → bun's built-in runner (fails on e2e without servers)\n- `bun run test:e2e` → runs scripts/e2e.ts which starts servers then runs `bun test e2e/`\n\nThe two test suites use different runners:\n- Unit tests use vitest APIs\n- E2E tests use bun:test APIs\n\n## Goal\nStandardize on bun:test everywhere. `bun test` should run all tests including e2e. Tests should be self-bootstrapping (no separate orchestration script).\n\n## Changes Required\n\n### 1. Migrate unit tests from vitest to bun:test\nFiles to update:\n- `api/buildGraphsFromIssues.test.ts`\n- `api/git-service.test.ts`\n- `api/logger.test.ts`\n- `api/sync-queue.test.ts`\n- `api/llm-tools.test.ts`\n- `api/tool-executor.test.ts`\n- `src/transformers/issueToNode.test.ts`\n- `src/transformers/dependencyToEdge.test.ts`\n- `src/transformers/dagLayout.test.ts`\n\nChanges per file:\n- Change `import { describe, it, expect, ... } from 'vitest'` to `import { ... } from 'bun:test'`\n- Update any vitest-specific matchers or features\n\n### 2. Make e2e test self-bootstrapping\nMove server setup/teardown from `scripts/e2e.ts` into `e2e/load-beads-issues.test.ts`:\n- Add server startup to the file-level `beforeAll` (before browser setup)\n- Add server shutdown to the file-level `afterAll` (after browser cleanup)\n- Include temp data directory creation/cleanup\n- Include the `waitForServer` polling logic\n\n### 3. Update ./check script\nChange `bun run test` to `bun test`\n\n### 4. Clean up package.json scripts\nRemove:\n- `\"test\": \"vitest run\"`\n- `\"test:watch\": \"vitest\"`\n- `\"test:e2e\": \"bun run scripts/e2e.ts\"`\n\n### 5. Delete obsolete files\n- `scripts/e2e.ts` (logic moved into test file)\n- `vitest.config.ts` (no longer needed)\n- `src/test-setup.ts` (vitest setup file, check if needed for bun:test)\n\n### 6. Update devDependencies (optional)\nConsider removing vitest from devDependencies if no longer needed.\n\n## Testing\nAfter changes, `bun test` should:\n- Run all unit tests\n- Run e2e tests (starting/stopping servers automatically)\n- Pass all tests","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T06:03:02.767554588Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-19T06:27:12.359694301Z","closed_at":"2026-01-19T06:27:12.359694301Z","close_reason":"Closed"}

When user selects a GitHub repo → sparse clone only the `.beads` directory\n2. All operations (read graph, create issues via chat) use `bd` commands against the local clone\n3.
